# Diffie-Hellman
Old Network Security Project.

Doesn't work properly yet. What I pushed has a worked version of the socket logic, but the algorithm is just off (so I can't tell if the math is 100%)

Either way, plan is to fix the algorithm, which is going to involve messing with the socket logic, to see if everything works out. I just need a working copy of my existing socket logic in case I lose myself (though, I think I have a handle on what's going on; I never have a handle on what's going on).
