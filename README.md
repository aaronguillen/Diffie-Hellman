# Diffie-Hellman
Old Network Security Project. Actually, when I turned it in back in the day it didn't work, but I made it work now.

Lot of cool crypto math in here.

As per usual, I'm sure the implementation could be more elegant, but, I did what I could.

It should be noted this was built on Windows 7 64-bit back when I took this class Fall Semester 2014, but I finished it running Windows 10 64-bit in October 2016. I built it using NetBeans 7.4 Build 201310111528 and Java 1.7.0_51

Here's what NetBeans 7.4 says:

Product Version: NetBeans IDE 7.4 (Build 201310111528)
Java: 1.7.0_51; Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 24.51-b03
Runtime: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.7.0_51-b13
System: Windows 8 version 6.2 running on amd64; Cp1252; en_US (nb)

I guess it thinks Windows 10 is Windows 8.
